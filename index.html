							<h2>Great Time</h2>
							<p>During a brief trek in Basantapur, Tinjure, I encountered a young boy engaged in play. Our group engaged in a lighthearted conversation with him. He happened to be the son of the cafe/Bhatti owner. Spending an hour there, we had an enriching discussion about the locality and its residents. The sparse population expressed their contentment with living in such a place, yet voiced concerns about the absence of nearby medical facilities. They highlighted the challenges of survival during emergencies due to the lack of immediate healthcare assistance.</p>

							<h2>Snow Area</h2>
							<p>During my trip to Basantapur, Tinjure, we encountered a captivating sight of massive rocks, clouds, and a religious rope. As the snow fell and temperatures dropped, my phone mysteriously experienced a rapid battery drain, going from 70% to 30% within a mere 10-15 seconds. This incident served as a reminder of how temperature impacts battery life. While we witnessed breathtaking mountain ranges that I failed to capture on camera, the sheer beauty we beheld with our naked eyes was indescribable.</p>

							<h2>Sun-Setting</h2>
							<p>
								The allure of cinematic visuals and sunsets has always captivated me, providing immense joy. Recently, I seized the opportunity to capture a photo with my phone. It was a day following the remarkable alignment of the Moon, Jupiter, and Venus in Nepal's vicinity. The clouds assumed a distinct pattern, stretching towards the sun. They delicately blanketed the entire sky in a slender proportion, creating a mesmerizing spectacle.</p>
							<br><p>As the sun begins to set,
								The sky is painted with hues of red.
								The world seems to slow down,
								As nature prepares to rest its crown.
								
								The clouds glow in the dying light,
								A sight so serene and pure.
								The birds fly back to their nests,
								As the sun bids farewell to allure.</p>

								On my way back from college, I encountered a captivating cloudy view that caught my attention. The sight was so compelling that I couldn't resist capturing it.

It served as a reminder of the beauty that can be found even in the simplest moments, inspiring me to appreciate the wonders of nature.The interplay of light and shadow within the clouds evoked a sense of tranquility, casting a peaceful ambiance over the surroundings.
