							<h2>Great Time</h2>
							<p>I went on a short trek of Basntapur, Tinjure with my relatives and cousins. Our group found this boy playing & we had a slightly childish conversation with him. He was the son of the owner of a cafe/Bhatti. We stayed there for 1 hour and had a great conversation about the place and the people living there. There were only a few people living there, and they just said one thing that it is good to live in these places but there is no hospital nearby. So, if a patient is in an emergency then it will be very hard to survive here as no immediate help can be brought here.</p>

							<h2>Snow Area</h2>
							<p>As mentioned above, I went on a short trek to Basantapur, Tinjure. We took a rest and found this fascinating view of bulky rocks, clouds, and a religious rope. Snow was falling as the temperature too. I don't know how but my phone's battery drained faster than the iPhone's xD: It went from 70% to 30% in just 10-15 seconds. Temperature does affect the battery life/health. We saw different mountain ranges, which I forgot to capture but, it was unbelievable and i think the camera couldn't catch tme beauty that we saw with our naked eye</p>

							<h2>Sun-Setting</h2>
							<p>I have always been fascinated by cinematics and sunsets. It brings me great pleasure. I captured this photo recently with my phone. I remembered it was the day after the Moon, Jupiter, and venus were seen in a straight line in Nepal's area. The clouds were scattered in a unique shape towards the sun. it was clearly seen that the cloud covered the whole sky in a thin ratio.</p>
							<br><p>As the sun begins to set,
								The sky is painted with hues of red.
								The world seems to slow down,
								As nature prepares to rest its crown.
								
								The clouds glow in the dying light,
								A sight so serene and pure.
								The birds fly back to their nests,
								As the sun bids farewell to allure.</p>
